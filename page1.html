        <p>This was my first time making a 3D game in Unity. Before this, I had followed a tutorial to make a 2D game to get acquainted with Unity and C#, but this was my first time making a game independently. I also only had a few days to work on it as this was during my university term.</p>
        <p>Things that I learnt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C#: How classes and objects are handled, how Unity namespaces are used to interact with the editor (in-game time management, audio, player preferences, etc.). </li>
            <li>Unity editor: Scenes, prefabs, triggers, animation, timelines, how to draw terrain, how to use the asset store. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As this was my first time making a game independently and as I didn't really have a plan for the gameplay, I made up my code architecture on the fly. This led to very convoluted interdependecies between classes and lots of bugs. I will try to plan future projects better to avoid this.</p>
        <p>The game follows a player that needs to fish. Once the player obtains a fishing rod, they must catch a fish in the lake, then put the fish on the campfire before the health bar reaches 0. Each time a fish is placed on the campfire, the difficutly increases. Once all levels are cleared, the player can interact with the boat to open the second scene. And finally, in the second scene, the player gets 'eaten by sharks' and the game ends.</p>
        <p>Below is a demonstration of the gameplay.</p>
